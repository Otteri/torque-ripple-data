PI-ILC-MS4887

MS4887-motor was connected to a load machine. Therefore, it was possible
to test the ILC performance under different loads and speeds. A resolver
and a torque-transducer readings were recorded.

Measurements were captured in generating and motoring modes.
Since the compensator was known to perform poorly in high speeds, 
and since the generating-mode 600rpm measurerements proved this, 
it was not seen necessary to do 600rpm measurements again in motoring mode.

The loads were recorded with respect to the load machine.
In order to obtain load values with respect to the machine running the ILC,
the measured load-values must be multiplied with a transformation coefficient:
0.8356.

PI-ILC-SDM251

This motor was known to have high cogging torque, so it was perfect for verifying
the results. However, the machine was not connected to anywhere so only no-load
experiments were possible. In orded to obtain additional data, different filtering
times were tested. 3 ms is the default value, which is being always used, unless
otherwise mentioned as the plan was to have plug-and-play compensator.
